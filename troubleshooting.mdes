❌ Error: Key Pair Not Created / Permission Denied
🔍 Problem Description
When running the deploy_script.sh script, the following error appeared:

🔑 Creating key pair: demo-key

arduino
Copiar
Editar
./deploy_script.sh: line 18: demo-key.pem: Permission denied
Additionally, when trying to launch the EC2 instance, it failed with:

vbnet
Copiar
Editar
An error occurred (InvalidKeyPair.NotFound) when calling the RunInstances operation: The key pair 'demo-key' does not exist
🧠 Cause
The script attempted to create a key pair (demo-key.pem), but:

The file demo-key.pem already existed with restrictive permissions

The content was empty (0 bytes) due to a previous error

The aws ec2 create-key-pair command could not overwrite it

This caused the EC2 instance launch to fail

✅ Solution
Exit the viewer by pressing q if you were viewing pasted text

Delete the local file:

bash
Copiar
Editar
rm demo-key.pem
Delete the key pair in AWS:

bash
Copiar
Editar
aws ec2 delete-key-pair --key-name demo-key
Run the script again:

bash
Copiar
Editar
./deploy_script.sh
🎯 Expected Result
demo-key.pem is successfully created

The EC2 instance DemoInstance is launched in the correct region

❌ Error: InvalidGroup.Duplicate
🔍 Problem Description
When executing the script, it attempted to create a security group named demo-sg, but it already existed in the VPC.

⚠️ Error Message
sql
Copiar
Editar
An error occurred (InvalidGroup.Duplicate) when calling the CreateSecurityGroup operation:  
The security group 'demo-sg' already exists for VPC 'vpc-xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx'
✅ Solution
Check if the security group already exists in the EC2 console. If it does, you can either:

Reuse it directly in the script, or

Delete it with the following command:

bash
Copiar
Editar
aws ec2 delete-security-group --group-name demo-sg
❌ Error: Unable to locate credentials
🔍 Problem Description
The script couldn't authenticate with AWS because credentials were not configured.

⚠️ Error Message

✅ Solution
Run the following command and provide:

bash
Copiar
Editar
aws configur
Then enter:

AWS Access Key ID

AWS Secret Access Key

Default region (e.g., us-east-1)

Output format (optional, e.g., json)
